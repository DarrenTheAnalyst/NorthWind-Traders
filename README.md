# NorthWind-Traders

The Northwind Traders Power BI Project illustrates my most complete understanding of Power BI to date. This understanding involves incorporating recent and new knowledge from the Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Associate course. The course has allowed me to appreciate the following â€“ 1) the total journey or roadmap from getting data, to modeling data, to visualizing and analyzing data and to managing the Power BI assets, 2) the ways in which the course has complemented my previous understanding of Power BI, 3) aspects of my previous learnings that were not explicitly covered in the course, but are no less important to the Power BI process. This third point may speak to the importance of learning from multiple sources. In all, I think that my learning was done in the most logical order with the Microsoft course acting in a complimentary fashion. The reason for this is simple. It was important however rudimentary to first achieve some familiarity with how to use Power BI to build reports and to do just that. At least that was my horse before the cart.
