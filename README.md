# NorthWind-Traders

The Northwind Traders Power BI Project illustrates my most complete expression of understanding of Power BI to date. This evolution has involved incorporating recent and new knowledge from the Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Associate course. The course has allowed me to appreciate the following â€“ 1) the total journey or roadmap from getting data, to modeling data, to visualizing and analyzing data and to managing the Power BI assets, 2) the ways in which the course has complemented my previous understanding of Power BI, 3) aspects of my previous learnings that were not explicitly covered in the course, but are no less important to the Power BI process. This third point may speak to the importance of learning from multiple sources. In all, I think that my learning was done in the most logical order with the Microsoft course acting in a complimentary fashion. It was important however rudimentary to first achieve some familiarity with how to use Power BI to build reports. The Microsoft course does not really teach that as it is mostly a step-by-step knowledge approach through the data journey.
